# OglesMath

Ogles Math is a math library written for personal use at work for doing OpenGL related work on Android.
Here are some of the main goals to this math library.

1. Easy to use and intuitive
2. Well documented 
3. Prevent side effects as much as possible
... and maybe something more

Many parts of the implementation will be based on the Three.js project and the interface will be based on Apple's GLKit.
Comments will be appreciated.
